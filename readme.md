## Models Selection


Explain about the models selection process.

Here we have take the models which we have been used in this Project 

Model Selection Process

1. Random Forest Algorithm : Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems and we have used this algorithm in our project.

2. Stochastic Gradient Descent : It is an Optimization algorithm that can be used to train neural network models. and it requires to be calculated for each variable in the models so that new values for the variables can be calculated.

3. Support Vector Machine Algorithm : This Algorithm is to fit to the data that you provide, returning a "best fit" hyperplane that divides, or categorizes, your data.it works best for low-dimensional data.

4. Kohonen self Organizing Map : It is computational Method for the visualization and analysis of high-dimensional data,it is an unsupervised learning approach and its network is trained through a competitive learning algorithm.
